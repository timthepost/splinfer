# Splinfer - A Flexible Inference Layer With Advanced Capabilities

Splinfer is the base for experimentation on how uncertainty affects model
hallucination tracks. It's currently a research prototype forked from the
old llama core and isn't yet for general use or consumption.

Requires libsplinter, and a whole lot of patience.
